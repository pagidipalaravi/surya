Create Single-Page Apps
    Using Knockout, oj-module component, and CoreRouter framework class, you can create single-page app.
    Rather than using multiple web pages navigation, app uses single web page that is loaded only once.
    JET includes support for single page apps using the CoreRouter class for virtual navigation in the page, 
    the oj-module component for managing view templates and viewModel scripts,
    Knockout for separating the model layer from the view layer and managing the binding between them.

    When routing a single-page app, the page doesn't reload from scratch but the content of the page changes dynamically.
    ex: browser history and bookmarks.
